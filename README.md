###         SCRIPTS/PLAYBOOKS FOR DEBIAN CONFIG 

bunch of scripts to automate the initial Sway installation and minimal easily-adaptable configuration of Debian

If you feel familiar with ansible you can use playbooks in lieu of scripts. These are treated separately and their intent is the same.
It's up to you which one to use. 

> 1. sway.sh/sway.yml  -- 
compositor installation and minimal environment

> 2. local.sh/local.yml  -- 
basic settings and packages I use, easily expandable

> 3. customization.sh/customization.yml  -- 
just apply my own basic customization

📍 _Please Note: these configurations are intended for the italian keyboard and language. Modify the data accordingly in the sway folder_
